This is kernel module code is for a Multichannel systems data
acquisition card (www.multichannelsystems.com). The code is still very
ALPHA and needs quite a bit of cleaning up. However, I've been using
it for over a month now and its quite stable on a PIII multiprocessor
platform (SGI 540 visual workstation running a linux kernal version
2.2.10).

The driver (module in this case) can be inserted or deleted from a
running kernel on the fly. Compilation and installation instructions
are located in INSTALL which should have accompanied this file. Since
this driver initially attempts to allocate a fairly large chunk of
contiguous memory for DMA purposes (about 300 msec of data) It should
be inserted as a module into the kernel just after the system is up
and running to allow it to grab free DMA memory pages. In the event
the user process cannot keep up with the data flowing into the DMA
buffers (ie you fall behind more than 300 msec worth), the module will
begin to overwrite the data silently. It will however keep count of
overruns.
