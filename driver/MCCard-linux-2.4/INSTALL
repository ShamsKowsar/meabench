Basic Installation
==================

  
Compilation instructions
========================

You must have a copy of the linux kernal (version 2.2.10 or above) installed on your machine. It should be located in /usr/src/linux or you will need to change where gcc looks for the kernel header files (the -I include flag)  in the Makefile.

1. cd to directory where you unpacked the files

2. To Create the object module by typing make
	

To install the module
=====================

As Root

1. Create a file device named MCCard with major # 250 and minor # 0:
	mknod /dev/MCCard c 250 0 
	chmod u+rw /dev/MCCard

2. To activate the module type:
	insmod MCCard.o

3. When installed it should print out a bit of info to /var/log/messages about how much memory for DMA transfers it was able to allocate. The device should also appear in /proc/interupts and /proc/modules. To verify simply type "lsmod" and you should see MCCard listed.

4. Access to the data acquistion card will now be through the file /dev/MCCard which to the user acts simply like a file that can be opened and read (see sample program read.c).

To remove the module
====================

As root type:

	Note:Make sure no one is accessing the device (with lsmod)
	Then type rmmod MCCard

Again, information will be printed about termination in /var/log/messages. You can verify termination by typing "lsmod" again if you wish.
