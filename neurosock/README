DW 2/6/02: Neurosock is distributed as part of meabench.
It consists of a server and client to transmit raw electrode data over a
TCP/IP socket. 
This is a work-around for UEI hardware, which doesn't really use DMA, and
hence takes up too much CPU time to run on the same computer as the
rest of meabench. (Unless you have several CPUs, I suppose.)

This server needs to run on a computer with rtlinux installed.
For me, configuration of the source is:

./configure --prefix=/opt/dw/neurosock \
  --with-rtlinux=/usr/src/rtlinux/rtlinux/include \
  --with-kernel=/usr/src/rtlinux/linux/include \
  --with-powerdaq=/usr/src/rtlinux/powerdaq/include

UEI hardware is not really recommended. MCS makes much better devices.
If you do consider getting the UEI stuff, contact me (wagenaar@caltech.edu)
to learn more about the issues involved.
